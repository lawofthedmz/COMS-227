# COMS-227: Introduction to Object-Oriented Coding

Welcome to COMS-227! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP). Throughout this course, you will complete a series of projects and homework assignments to help you understand and apply OOP concepts.

## Course Overview

In COMS-227, you will learn the principles of object-oriented programming using Java. The course includes eight (nine, but I skipped one) projects and four homework assignments, each designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in lectures.

## Projects

### Lab 1: Greeter 

### Lab 2: Intro to Classes

### Lab 3: JUnit

### Lab 4: Eclipse Debugger

### Lab 5: Loops

### Lab 6: Scanner

### Lab 7: Recursion

### Lab 8: Polymorphism

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1: Hotair Balloon
- **Description:** For this assignment you will create a hot air balloon simulator. Specifically, you are
implementing a single class called Balloon, that models the flight of a hot air balloon taking
multiple factors into account, for example: the mass of the balloon, outside air temperature,
available fuel, rate of fuel burn, etc.

### Homework 2: Fuzzball Game
- **Description:** The purpose of this assignment is to give you lots of practice working with conditional logic and
managing the internal state of a class. You'll create one class, called FuzzballGame, that is a
model of an obscure game played with a ball and a stick1 . Although there is some resemblance to
the American game of baseball, it's probably best if you forget everything you know about
baseball as you read these instructions. Your job is to implement the rules of the game that is
specified in this document even if that conflicts with your understanding of any other baseball
game rules.

### Homework 3: Lizard Game
- **Description:** The purpose of this assignment is to give you lots of practice working with conditional logic and
managing the internal state of a class. You'll create one class, called FuzzballGame, that is a
model of an obscure game played with a ball and a stick1 . Although there is some resemblance to
the American game of baseball, it's probably best if you forget everything you know about
baseball as you read these instructions. Your job is to implement the rules of the game that is
specified in this document even if that conflicts with your understanding of any other baseball
game rules.

### Homework 4: Abstract Element
- **Description:** n this project you will complete the implementation of a hierarchy of classes representing
various types of elements in a video game. Your task is to implement these eight concrete classes:
SimpleElement, AttachedElement, FlyingElement, FollowerElement, LiftElement, MovingElement, PlatformElement, VanishingElement

## Installation and Setup

To set up the environment for this course, follow these steps:

1. Install java from https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd coms-227
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    [Then install dependencies]
    ```

## Usage

Each project and homework assignment includes a detailed README file with instructions on how to run and test your code. Navigate to the respective directories to find these instructions.
